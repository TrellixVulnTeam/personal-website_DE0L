I'm a self-taught programmer since high school. In the beginning, I started learning via YouTube. Later I learned web-development from Udemy and personal projects. My theoretical background comes from my studies in Physics and computer science courses at university. Here I learned more about machine learning. This page is about my academic and technical background; projects [can be found here](/founder).

# Academic background and computer science

Until now, I have written a seminar paper on the topic "Privacy Preserving Machine Learning vs Explainable Machine Learning in Healthcare".

# Stack

In my projects, I used a wide range of web technology. Currently, I use Typescript with Angular framework and GraphQL as backend technology.
You can find projects I can talk about publicly [in my portfolio](/founder).
