I'm a self-taught progammer since highschool. At the beginning I startet learning via YouTube, later I learned web-development from Udemy and personal projects. My theoretical background comes from my studies in Physics and computer science cources at university. Here I learned, in adition, more about machine learning. 
This page is about my academic and technical background, 
projects [can be found elsewhere](/founder).

# Academic background and computer science
Until now I have written a seminar paper on the topic "Privacy Preserving Machine Learning vs Explainable Machine Learning in Healthcare". 


# Stack
In my projects I used a wide range of web technology. Currently I use Typescript with Angular framework and GraphQL as backend technology.

You can find projects I can talk about publicly [in my portfolio](/founder).
